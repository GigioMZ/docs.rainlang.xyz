To celebrate the release of the Raindex app and deployment on Flare, we’re launching a trading strategy competition with $12,000 worth of FLR in prizes.

Whether you’re new to decentralized finance or a seasoned strategist, this competition is a platform to innovate, impact, and get inspired. 

Rainlang is a new, onchain language that is the native language of DeFi. It’s designed to be far easier to write than Solidity - if you can write spreadsheet formulas you can probably learn Rainlang.

Why is this important? Raindex gives you the flexibility and power usually associated with CEX trading or running bots, whilst retaining the attributes we’re all here for - it’s trustless, permissionless and decentralised. It empowers users to craft and execute trading strategies without intermediaries. It’s also completely onchain, which means users don’t need to put their funds in someone else’s hands or put their hot wallet private keys in a bot connected to the internet.

Why Flare? Flare offers a unique trust model for the oracles on their network as the data availability and integrity is provided by the validators themselves. Raindex exposes these oracles directly to traders, without needing devs. The Flare Time Series Oracles (FTSOs) words are available in Raindex, to use in your strategies.

To enter the competition you simply need to create your strategy then deploy it on the Flare network. Entries should focus on robustness of the strategy and market adaptability to stand out in the competition.

There will also be a prize specifically for technical writing, judged by [Rareskills](https://www.rareskills.io/), the leading web3 educators. Submitting for this prize will also put you in the running for a full-time technical writing job with Rareskills.

Support will be given to all entrants to learn Rainlang and get their questions answered. Best of all, you get to participate in a community dedicated to pushing the boundaries of DeFi.

### How to participate
1. Join the Raindex community [Telegram](https://t.me/+W0aQ36ptN_E2MjZk) to get help as you put your strategy together

3. Deploy your strategy on the Flare network and deposit assets to trade
4. Share your strategy on X or Farcaster, tagging [@flarenetworks](https://twitter.com/FlareNetworks) and [@rainprotocol](https://twitter.com/rainprotocol).

### Judging criteria
First and second prizes will be judged on overall quality, keeping in mind the following criteria:

- Creativity - show off your unique thinking
- Understanding of market conditions - all strategies are not applicable to all market conditions, keep in mind what conditions your strategy is meant for

#### Best use of Flare Time Series Oracles (FTSOs) $2500 (Flare)
