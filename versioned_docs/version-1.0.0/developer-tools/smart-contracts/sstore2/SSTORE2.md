## Functions
### `write(bytes _data) → address pointer` (internal)

Stores `_data` and returns `pointer` as key for later retrieval
    @dev The pointer is a contract address with `_data` as code
    @param _data to be written
    @return pointer Pointer to the written `_data`



### `read(address _pointer) → bytes` (internal)

Reads the contents of the `_pointer` code as data, skips the first
    byte
    @dev The function is intended for reading pointers generated by `write`
    @param _pointer to be read
    @return data read from `_pointer` contract



### `read(address _pointer, uint256 _start) → bytes` (internal)

Reads the contents of the `_pointer` code as data, skips the first
    byte
    @dev The function is intended for reading pointers generated by `write`
    @param _pointer to be read
    @param _start number of bytes to skip
    @return data read from `_pointer` contract



### `read(address _pointer, uint256 _start, uint256 _end) → bytes` (internal)

Reads the contents of the `_pointer` code as data, skips the first
    byte
    @dev The function is intended for reading pointers generated by `write`
    @param _pointer to be read
    @param _start number of bytes to skip
    @param _end index before which to end extraction
    @return data read from `_pointer` contract
