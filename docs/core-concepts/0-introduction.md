# Introduction

Welcome to the Rain Protocol core concepts. We'll introduce you to Rain, a new way to design smart contracts that emphasises pratical decentralisation via permissionless transparency and social curation.

The goal of Rain is to increase accessibility, allow for anti-fragile models of peer-to-peer trust, and create new applications and business models.

These guides are best read in order, but feel free to jump to any section.
