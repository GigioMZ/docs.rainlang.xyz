The Raindex app is an open source, standalone app you can use to write, deploy and manage your orders. It was important for us to build a front-end that was totally self-hosted and that anyone could build from source. 

The app is in its early development stages and contracts are unaudited so be careful and as always, DYOR.

Available for Intel or ARM Mac running macOS 14. Linux support is coming soon.
