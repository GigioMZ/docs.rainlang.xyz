RainVM opcode pack to operate on tier reports.
The opcodes all map to functions from `ITier` and associated libraries such
as `TierConstants`, `TierwiseCombine`, and `TierReport`. For each, the
order of consumed values on the stack corresponds to the order of arguments
to interface/library functions.
