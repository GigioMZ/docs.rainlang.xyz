# Why onchain?

The choice to have an Orderbook entirely onchain may seem unintuitve at first, but with the maturity of EVM scaling solutions the gas cost for deploying and managing perpetual strategies becomes more feasible. And doing things onchain has some crucial benefits.

### Transparency
Onchain operations are fully visible to all participants in the network. Every order, every strategy, and every transaction can be audited and verified by any party, ensuring a high degree of trust and accountability.

### Security
By having the Rain Orderbook and strategies onchain, we leverage the inherent security of the EVM, ensuring that orders and strategies are tamper-proof and immutable once they're deployed.

### Decentralization
An onchain orderbook is not controlled by any single entity or centralized server. This means there's no single point of failure, and it's resistant to any potential shutdowns, censorship, or external control.

### Interoperability
Being onchain allows the Rain Orderbook to seamlessly interact with other onchain protocols, smart contracts, and decentralized applications. This opens up avenues for enhanced functionality, integrations, and collaborations in the decentralized ecosystem.

### Zero latency
With onchain operations, strategies are evaluated in the same block as the trade itself. Any onchain data referenced is up to date, and trade calculation and execution is atomic.

### Custody and Control
Users retain full custody of their assets when interacting with the onchain orderbook. Unlike centralized platforms where funds are often held by the platform, here, assets remain in users' control until the moment a trade is executed, ensuring maximum security and autonomy.

### Permissionless Innovation
An onchain infrastructure allows for permissionless interactions. Anyone can build upon, integrate with, or propose enhancements to the Rain Orderbook without seeking approvals or access permissions. This fosters an environment of open innovation and continuous improvement.
