A multiparty commit/reveal scheme designed to generate a shared
seed that impacts involved parties directly. For example, generating the
seed for a lottery/shuffle mechanic that maps NFT IDs to their metadata.

SeedDance does NOT implement any access or integrity checks (e.g. to ensure
that the correct `TimeBound` is passed to `_reveal`) as it is unopinionated
as to how inheriting contracts expose the dance to end users. Therefore it
is insecure by default, until the implementing contract carefully defines
participants and time bounds.

Assuming that interactive seed generation is an acceptible UX/workflow, the
main problem with commit/reveal schemes such as this is the "last actor"
weakness. Whoever is the last party to reveal the secret can see every
prior reveal, and knows the outcome of revealing their secret, so has an
outsized degree of control over the final result. The last actor can choose
if (can simply refuse to reveal) and when (dangerous if able to collude
with minter to manipulate results) they reveal.

Common mitigation strategies involve rewards for revealing and punishments
for not revealing. SeedDance makes some assumptions about how the seed is
to be generated and used, allowing it to focus on _fairness_ of outcome
rather than trying to avoid there being a last actor.

There WILL always be some last actor in every seed dance, but:
- Nobody can predict who the last actor is ahead of time
- It is difficult to predict who the last actor will be _during_ the dance
- Everyone is equally likely to be in the position of last actor
- Everyone chooses for themselves if/when to act, the order is not preset
- Anyone who can currently reveal during the dance may randomise all other
  actor's ability to act

This is achieved by granting every address a random (up to a maximum)
additional duration during which they may reveal their secret. Only the
commiter of a secret may reveal it and have the shared secret updated, so
we can restrict the time window during which each agent may meaningfully
reveal the secret. Of course an agent may reveal a secret in a failed
transaction and then everyone will be able to see it, but it won't change
the seed. Every time a secret is revealed, it randomises everyone's time
windows, thus implicitly changing who MAY be the last actor. This random
shuffling MAY remove someone's ability to reveal that they previously had,
or grant the ability to reveal to someone who had previously timed out.
This mitigates the ability to manipulate the system by trying to be the
last actor in the following ways:
- The current last actor has only 1/N chance of being the last actor after
  each reveal
- The longer the current last actor waits to reveal, the more likely it is
  they will lose the ability to reveal at all the next time their window is
  randomised, as they MAY be randomised to a time in the past
- The longer any actor waits to reveal, the more likely they are to be
  front run on their reveal and have the subsequent shuffle rollback their
  attempt to reveal (because other agents know their own secret and can see
  the reveal in the mempool before it exists onchain)
- As the reveal times are frequently being shuffled it is much more
  difficult for an agent to manipulate or censor a single or several blocks
  as/with a miner/validator to manipulate the overall outcome of the dance

Note that as the secret is broadcast to the mempool as soon as reveal is
called, all other participants MAY front run the reveal in an attempt to
grief that reveal. Similarly miners can reorg or exclude any
reveal within a single block arbitrarily. While this likely will
disadvantage the greifee it will still result in at least one global reseed
and the greifer will consume their secret and commitment in the process.
Subsequently some other seeder MAY roll the seed again in a way that
allows the griefee access to the dance once more, but the griefer will have
used their secret and so cannot attack a second time.

It is entirely that cartels form attempting to reseed the dance in their
favour. In this case the best defense is a statistical one, for example an
NFT project can engineer their rarities such that a large cartel implies a
large sample size, so each reseed becomes increasingly boring as the cartel
grows, thus undermining the advantage of having a cartel in the first place.
This can work as statistically the chance of achieving an average outcome
increases as the number of samples (members of the cartel) increases.

However, a griefing cartel MAY form with the sole goal to prevent a single
or small number of addresses from acheiving a desirable outcome. In this
case the attack MAY succeed if the cartel represents a large percentage of
the dancers, but it still only requires a single reseed after the cartel
performs its actions to completely negate all cartel actions. There is no
specific defense against this kind of attack, other than to hope the chaos
of the dance thwarts the cartel in the moment. One must ask why a cartel
would form (which involves e.g. mass minting/buying NFTs) in the first
place merely to perform a DOS style attack on a single wallet. It MAY
happen sometime, but we expect it is unlikely to be a common occurance.

As there are no external or financial incentives required by the system,
the dance instead relies on "skin in the game". The addresses that are
allowed to commit secrets before the dance should only be those that are
DIRECTLY impacted by the outcome of the final seed. For example, in the NFT
mint/reveal workflow the dancers should be restricted to those addresses
that bought/minted NFT IDs and so are impacted by the metadata assignment.
By disallowing unaffected third parties it helps minimise the participation
of wallets who simply want to grief some address with no cost (besides gas)
to themselves.

Of course, as with all commit/reveal schemes, the secrets must be commited
before the dance starts and the reveal will fail if the secret provided
does not match the commitment. This prevents trivial manipulation of the
outcome by "revealing" arbitrary secrets designed to benefit the revealer.

The dance starts when `_start` is called. This is an internal function that
will fail if called more than once, but has no access controls by default.
There is no explicit end to the dance. The dance is complete when no more
agents will reveal their secret. This can only be observed once either all
secrets are revealed or all times have expired, but it MAY be effectively
true but impossible to measure when all parties are satisfied with the
outcome of the dance and so will choose not to reveal.

There is no requirement that everyone reveals their secrets and the choice
of initial seed is almost arbitrary. A block hash or similar can be used
as all participants may immediately reseed any initial seed that they are
not satisfied with. Even if a miner were to manipulate the starting seed it
would be very likely to be hashed into something else that the miner cannot
control or predict.


## Variables
### `Seed` `_sharedSeed`


## Events
### `Start(address sender, Seed initialSeed)`

The dance has started.




### `Commit(address sender, Commitment commitment)`

A new commitment is made.




### `Reveal(address sender, Secret secret, Seed newSeed)`

A secret has been revealed.





## Modifiers
### `onlyNotStarted()`

Require this function to only be callable before the dance has started.




## Functions
### `_start(Seed initialSeed_)` (internal)

Start the dance. Can only happen once.
Has no access control so the implementing contract must safeguard the
workflow and decide when to start.




### `_commit(Commitment commitment_)` (internal)

Before the dance starts anyone can commit a secret.
Has no access control so if committers is to be a closed set it must be
enforced by the implementing contract. The implementing contract SHOULD
ensure that only users with "skin in the game" can commit secrets, to
mitigate griefing strategies where sybils endlessly reseed at no cost
to themselves.
Users are free to commit as many times as they like prior to the dance
starting, which will overwrite previous commitments rending them
unusable during the dance. Once the dance starts no further additions
or changes to commitments can be made.




### `_reveal(struct TimeBound timeBound_, Secret secret_)` (internal)

`msg.sender` reveals a valid secret, changing the shared seed and
consuming their commitment. To successfully reveal the sender MUST
complete the reveal within their personal time as defined by the
provided time bounds and current shared seed.
The implementing contract MUST ensure the validity of the time bounds
being passed in and any additional access controls for reveals.
Each secret can only be revealed once as the commitment will be deleted
after the first reveal per-secret.
Users can ONLY reveal their own commitments BUT their secret will be
publicly visible as soon as the transaction hits the mempool, so they
SHOULD NOT attempt a reveal if they believe the transaction will fail,
including due to being front run by other reveals reshuffling times.




### `canRevealUntil(Seed seed_, uint256 start_, struct TimeBound timeBound_, address owner_) â†’ uint256 until_` (public)

Every owner can reveal until some time but this time is different for
every owner, and is reshuffled for every new shared secret.
