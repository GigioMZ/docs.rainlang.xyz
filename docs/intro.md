# Rainlang

Rain is a framework that aims to simplify smart contracts and make them more accessible to a wider audience.

This is grounded in our belief that accessibility is the difference between theoretical and practical decentralisation. There are many people who would like to participate in authoring and auditing smart contracts but currently cannot. When this scenario arises, people delegate to someone who can do the thing they want - this is by definition centralisation.

The goal of Rain is to further decentralize the industry - make contracts more readable, make centralized solutions more visible, increase developer accessibility and create new applications and business models.
