  this is the problem
- i don't understand the new features/changes like you do
- i know you try to involve me in the changes you're making early on but im hardly ever in the headspace to absorb what you're telling me
- because im still trying to wrap my head around the thing from weeks ago
- i need documentation
- not telegram pings
- please just describe what you've done in a PR
- perhaps even [[diagrams]] idk
-
- thedavidmeister, [12 Dec 2022 at 09:33:52]:
  i try to do about a day's worth of documentation every week
- Marcus Newton, [12 Dec 2022 at 09:34:18]:
  are you referring to PR documentation?
- thedavidmeister, [12 Dec 2022 at 09:34:32]:
  also [[documentation]] on our [[documentation repo]]
- and i spend hours on TG explaining stuff
-
- thedavidmeister, [12 Dec 2022 at 09:38:28]:
  what are you doing to document and track your testing plans?
- other than the tests themselves?
- Marcus Newton, [12 Dec 2022 at 09:39:19 (12 Dec 2022 at 09:39:25)]:
  i have a [[saved telegram messages]] backlog and my own notepad when i need it
- thedavidmeister, [12 Dec 2022 at 09:39:27]:
  we do have 700 tests, it's a fair chunk of code
- ok that's useful
- Marcus Newton, [12 Dec 2022 at 09:40:17]:
  i save every message you ping me
- which refers to a potential test
- thedavidmeister, [12 Dec 2022 at 09:40:44]:
  i find all the time i spend discussing things in TG very valuable because often after i talk about it with the team things change
- but it does take a fair bit of time, and doing the docs repo as well, and also planning things like sketches
-
- Marcus Newton, [12 Dec 2022 at 09:46:07]:
  i do like working with you early though
- into a new feature
- because it definitely leads to a more robust design
-
- Marcus Newton, [12 Dec 2022 at 10:15:06]:
  yeah i've used that before
- thedavidmeister, [12 Dec 2022 at 10:15:29]:
  is it good?
- Marcus Newton, [12 Dec 2022 at 10:15:40]:
  its my favourite graph-based notetaking app
- i havent used it collaboratively though
- thedavidmeister, [12 Dec 2022 at 10:16:00]:
  it's written with datascript in clojure ðŸ™‚
- i just went to see if tonsky had anything ðŸ˜‚
- maybe we could?
- Marcus Newton, [12 Dec 2022 at 10:17:00]:
  im super down
- thedavidmeister, [12 Dec 2022 at 10:17:08]:
  it's [[markdown]] based yeah?
- Marcus Newton, [12 Dec 2022 at 10:17:12]:
  yep
- superset of markdown
- thedavidmeister, [12 Dec 2022 at 10:17:25]:
  would it make sense to layer it over a [[static site generator]]?
- or, does it render sites that ppl can use?
- Marcus Newton, [12 Dec 2022 at 10:17:48]:
  just has some stuff like [[Double Brackets]] for tagging other pages
- thedavidmeister, [12 Dec 2022 at 10:18:01]:
  can we serve the pages somehow?
